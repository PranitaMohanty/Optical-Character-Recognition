# OCR(Optical Character Recognition) 

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) models can be run on both GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and CPU (Central Processing Unit) architectures. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

In general, OCR models tend to be computationally intensive, and running them on a GPU can significantly speed up the processing time. This is because GPUs have many cores that can perform parallel processing, making them well-suited for matrix operations and other tasks that are common in OCR.

However, not all projects require the high processing power of a GPU. In some cases, running an OCR model on a CPU may be sufficient, especially if the model is relatively simple or if the project has limited computational resources.

Some popular OCR models that can run on both GPU and CPU include:

Texify: A Python-based OCR model that can run on both GPU and CPU architectures. EasyOCR: A Python-based OCR model that can run on both GPU and CPU architectures, and also supports multi-GPU training. YOLO-based OCR models: These models use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect text in images, and can run on both GPU and CPU architectures. In my project using NVIDIA graphics card we can easily gat an OCR model from gpu to cpu
